"""Bridge that runs a Manim scene and returns its frames as BGR numpy arrays,
bypassing Manim's own video writer entirely.

On this machine, Manim 0.19's built-in writer (PyAV-backed) produces corrupt
partial-movie files and fails combining them into a final mp4 -- verified via a
smoke test (`ffprobe` reports "Invalid data found" / "No start code" on the raw
partial files Manim itself wrote, before any file-list or path handling is even
involved). Manim's own *rendering* is fine; only its H.264 encode step is broken
here. So we monkeypatch `SceneFileWriter.write_frame` to capture each rendered
frame into a plain Python list instead of pushing it into Manim's writer queue,
and no-op `finish()` so it never attempts the broken combine step. The frames are
then handed to `drishti.io_utils.VideoWriter`, the ffmpeg-subprocess writer this
project already uses everywhere else, which is known-good on this machine.
