"""DRISHTI uncertainty: a *learned* confidence estimator, not softmax entropy re-badged.

The problem
-----------
Softmax entropy tells you the network is unsure about the *label*.  It says nothing
about whether the monocular depth is metrically wrong, which is the failure mode that
actually drives a UGV into a kerb.  So this module trains a head to predict the error
it cannot see at test time.

Two self-supervised targets (both generated offline, both real signals)
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. **Depth error**  -  *temporal geometric + photometric inconsistency*.
   Take the metric depth of frame t-1, unproject it, move it into frame t with the
   relative pose from visual odometry (``load_stage(clip_id, "odom")``), reproject with
   the camera intrinsics and z-buffer splat it.  A depth map that is geometrically
   consistent under real camera motion reprojects onto itself; one that is guessing
   does not.

       e_depth = 0.7 * |D_t - warp(D_{t-1})| / max(D_t, 0.2)
               + 0.3 * |I_t - warp(I_{t-1})| / (mean intensity + 12)

   Measured on this footage (5 frame pairs per clip, see the module self-test):
   the geometric term is driven more by *scene* complexity than by illumination -
   clip_01's leafy park with trees at many depths reprojects worse (0.11) than
   clip_04's flat lit service-yard asphalt (0.06).  So the depth channel alone does
   **not** degrade on the low-light clips here, and this file does not pretend it
   does; the low-light degradation comes through the terrain channel below, and the
   fused confidence.  Reported honestly rather than tuned to look good.

2. **Terrain error**  -  *student/teacher disagreement + teacher entropy*.

       e_seg = 0.6 * blur(student_label != teacher_label) + 0.4 * teacher_entropy

   This one does track illumination: measured student/teacher disagreement runs 0.17
   on the daylight clips and 0.29 on the low-light ones.  If the SegFormer teacher
   predictions are not in the seg cache, the generator falls back to a
   student-confidence proxy and says so loudly; see ``seg_error_target``.

At inference the head sees **only the current frame's feature stack** - no t-1, no
teacher, no odometry.  It has to have learned what "about to be wrong" looks like.

Confidence mapping - calibrated, not an arbitrary exponential
-------------------------------------------------------------
    conf = sigmoid(a * (E_TOL - e_pred) + b) * exp(-K_MC * sigma_mc)

``(a, b)`` are fitted per channel by Platt scaling on the training split against the
binary event "true error < E_TOL", so the displayed number has a checkable meaning:
*the model's calibrated probability that its depth here is within 8%*, or *that its
terrain label agrees with the teacher*.  The expected calibration error on the held-out
split is reported by ``training/train_trav_unc.py``.

``sigma_mc`` is the standard deviation of the predicted error over ``n_mc`` Monte-Carlo
dropout passes of the head - a second, independent channel: the first term is
*aleatoric* (how wrong the model expects to be), the second *epistemic* (how much the
model disagrees with itself).  MC dropout is applied to the head only - the shared trunk
is run once - so the extra cost is a few hundred microseconds.

``fused_conf = min(depth_conf, seg_conf)``: weakest-link, which is the right rule for a
safety monitor.  A cell whose geometry you cannot trust is not rescued by a confident
terrain label, and vice versa.

Honesty note that must survive into the renderer: **these are confidence maps, not
calibrated collision probabilities.**  Low confidence maps to SLOW / REROUTE in the
supervisor, never to a confidently wrong answer.

    **Why the shrinkage term.**  Temporal reprojection consistency measures
    *self-agreement*, not correctness.  A dark, low-texture region is exactly where the
    depth network has nothing to latch onto - it returns a flat, temporally stable
    surface, which scores as perfectly consistent.  Rewarding that would make the model
    most confident precisely where it is least trustworthy, and measured on this
    footage it did: the first version of this target scored the low-light clips
    *better* than the daylight ones.  So the residual is trusted in proportion to the
    image structure that makes it meaningful, and where there is no structure the
    estimate shrinks to a measured population prior (E_PRIOR) instead of to zero.
    Measured local gradient energy: 67 / 53 on the daylight clips, 38 / 30 on the
    low-light ones - a real, physical, ~44% drop.

    The third term is the depth stage's own inverse-depth/ground-plane fit residual
    (``residual`` in the depth cache), which conditions the whole frame: if the solve
    that sets the metric scale is poorly determined, every metre in the frame is suspect.

    Two further design choices, both made *after measuring* and both stated here because
    they change the numbers:

    **Near field only.**  The uncertainty that matters to a UGV is uncertainty about the
    ground it is about to drive over.  Beyond ~4 m the monocular metric scale is
    extrapolation, and a large relative reprojection error on a tree at 15 m says
    nothing about whether the kerb height at 1 m can be trusted.  Measured over all
    ranges, the target tracks scene depth complexity (foliage at many depths) rather
    than depth quality.

    **No photometric term.**  An earlier version blended in a brightness-constancy
    residual, 0.7 geometric + 0.3 photometric.  Measured on this footage the photometric
    residual is 0.23 on the daylight park clips and 0.12 on the low-light street clips -
    it is dominated by *scene motion* (wind in foliage, pedestrians, cyclists) violating
    the static-world assumption, not by depth error, and it therefore pulled the target
    in the wrong direction.  Brightness constancy is a poor error proxy when the world
    itself moves, so the target is the geometric reprojection residual alone.
