"""Goal-directed navigation settings (Point A -> Point B).

Kept out of `drishti/config.py` on purpose: that file is frozen contract (see
CONTRACT.md) and every perception module depends on it byte-for-byte.  The
settings below are only read by the goal layer added on top of the arc planner:
`goal_planner.py`, `dstar_lite.py`, `goal_map.py` and
`perception/dynamic_layer.py`.

Units follow the rest of DRISHTI: metres, seconds, radians, and the vehicle frame
is X right, Y forward, yaw CCW from +Y.
